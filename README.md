🕒 Internship Project-2: HTML/CSS/JavaScript Stopwatch Timer 🕒

I'm excited to share my latest project, a Stopwatch Timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🚀

🌐 Project Overview:
In this internship project, I had the fantastic opportunity to create a fully functional Stopwatch Timer with a sleek and user-friendly design. This project allowed me to apply my skills in web development and enhance my proficiency in JavaScript.

🎨 Front-end Design:
I designed a visually appealing interface using HTML and CSS, incorporating animations and hover effects to provide an engaging and attractive user experience. The design reflects my passion for creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing web applications.

⏱️ Functionality:
The Stopwatch Timer features three essential buttons:

Start: Initiates the timer.
Stop: Pauses the timer, allowing users to resume where they left off.
Reset: Resets the timer to zero, providing a clean slate.
👩‍💻 JavaScript Magic:
I leveraged JavaScript to power the timer and control its functions. Through JavaScript, I enabled dynamic updates of the timer display and ensured smooth interaction between the user and the stopwatch.

I'm thrilled with the outcome of this project and the skills I've honed along the way. It's a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and my passion for creating web applications that blend functionality and aesthetics seamlessly.
